<summary>Implementation</summary>

Implementation is the stage where theoretical design is turned into a working system. It is one of the most important stages in achieving a new successful system and in giving confidence to the New users to use it more efficiently and effectively. It involves careful coming up with, investigation of this system and its constraints on implementation.

<summary>Implementation Procedure</summary>

### User Registration
**Steps:**
1. Collect the user's phone number during the registration process.
2. Verify the phone number by sending a one-time verification code.
3. Confirm user identity upon successful code verification.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
function authenticateUser():
    phoneNumber = collectPhoneNumber()
    verificationCode = sendVerificationCode(phoneNumber)

    if verifyCode(enteredCode, verificationCode):
        confirmUserIdentity()
    else:
        displayErrorMessage()
```

### Friendship Management
**Steps:**
- **Friend Request Handling:**
  - Design the interface for sending and receiving friend requests.
  - Implement logic for accepting or rejecting friend requests.
- **Friend List Management:**
  - Develop functionality for maintaining a user's list of friends.
  - Allow users to unfriend or block other users as needed.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
function handleFriendRequest(senderId, receiverId, action):
    displayFriendRequestInterface(senderId)
    
    if action == "accept":
        acceptFriendRequest(senderId, receiverId)
    elif action == "reject":
        rejectFriendRequest(senderId, receiverId)

function manageFriendList(userId, action, friendId):
    if action == "unfriend":
        unfriendUser(userId, friendId)
    elif action == "block":
        blockUser(userId, friendId)
```

### Task Creation
**Steps:**
1. Task Form Design:
   - Create an intuitive user interface for entering task details.
   - Include relevant fields such as title, description, due date, and priority.
2. Task Validation:
   - Implement validation checks to ensure the correctness of task details.
   - Notify users of any errors in the task creation process.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
function designTaskForm():
    displayTaskFormInterface()

function validateTaskDetails(title, description, dueDate, priority):
    if isValidTitle(title) and isValidDescription(description) and isValidDueDate(dueDate) and isValidPriority(priority):
        return true
    else:
        notifyUserOfErrors()
        return false
```

### Task Assignment
**Steps:**
- User Selection:
  - Design a mechanism for selecting users to whom tasks will be assigned.
  - Include options for individual and group assignments.
- Notification System:
  - Implement a notification system to inform users of assigned tasks.
  - Allow users to acknowledge or decline task assignments.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
function designUserSelectionMechanism():
    displayUserSelectionInterface()
    includeOptionsForIndividualAndGroupAssignments()

function implementNotificationSystem(taskId, assigneeId):
    notifyUser(assigneeId, "You have been assigned a new task.")
    if userAcknowledgesAssignment():
        displayAssignmentSuccessMessage()
    else:
        handleDeclinedAssignment(taskId, assigneeId)
```
