<summary>Release Testing</summary>

Release testing refers to coding practices and test strategies that give teams confidence that a software release candidate is ready for users. It aims to find and eliminate errors and bugs from a software release to ensure it can be released to users. The release testing system has been tested using release management, and there were no major issues.

<summary>Unit Test</summary>

Unit testing involves checking individual software modules or components as part of the software testing process. The goal is to confirm that each piece of software code operates as intended. Developers perform unit testing during the application's coding phase, isolating specific pieces of code and validating their accuracy. A singular function, method, process, module, or object might be considered a unit.
